 ## What's Inside?

🔍 **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  Before diving into model-building, it's crucial to understand the data. In this section, I uncover hidden patterns and insights using:

  📊 Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and more!)

  🔥 Correlation heatmaps to detect relationships between features

  🏗️ Feature engineering to improve model performance

---

❓ **2. Handling Missing Values**

 Missing data? No worries! Learn how to handle them like a pro:

  🔄 Imputation techniques (mean, median, mode, KNN imputer, etc.)

  🧐 Impact of missing values on model performance
 
  📉 Strategies to minimize data loss while preserving information

---

🤖 **3. Machine Learning Algorithms**



🎯 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

📌 Finding the optimal K for accuracy

📏 Distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan & more

🏷️ Real-world classification examples
